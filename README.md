# SbJwlLauncher

A Windows command-line tool to launch JW Library and set its main window position. Use like this:

SbJwlLauncher 100 100 800 600

This command will launch JWL with a main window positioned at x=100, y=100, width=800, height=600

Note that the JWL process is also modified so that it runs at above normal priority.
